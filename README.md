# silence-remover
I needed a way to trim out the silence from the beginning and end of many audio files I had, but didn't find a decent solution that was free. So I did it myself (kind of), thanks internet!

## Description
It's self-explanatory; the script scans through all the audio files in the folder (including subfolders), trims out the silence from the start and end of the file, and replaces the file with the trimmed version.
